Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

The solve method has a recursive structure, with a loop that iterates n/2 times (since i increments by 2).
For each iteration, it calls itself recursively with arguments i and n-i-1.
The recursive calls have a complexity of O(4^(i/2) / i^(3/2)) and O(4^((n-i-1)/2) / (n-i-1)^(3/2)), respectively, due to the Catalan number formula.
The loop iterates n/2 times, so the total complexity is the sum of the complexities of each iteration.
Using the Master Theorem, we can simplify the complexity to O(4^n / n^(3/2)).

Note that the memoization (using the memo map) helps to avoid redundant computations and reduces the time complexity. Without memoization, the time complexity would be much higher, likely exponential in n.

The space complexity is O(4^n / n^(3/2)) as well, since we need to store the results of each recursive call in the memo map.

Keep in mind that this analysis assumes that the TreeNode class has a constant-time constructor and that the add operation on the ArrayList has an amortized constant time complexity.
